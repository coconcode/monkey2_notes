In this section there will be some thoughts on how is it better to break or split lines.

Examples

	* Arrays

		Here placing closing parentheses in a new line is useful for giving a visual clue
		where the array declaration section ends, thus that way forming a block section.
		Also keeping the very last comma helps in some cases of swapping or commenting elements,
		without having to do more edits.
		
		Global array := New String[] (
			"Alpha",
			"Beta",
			"Gamma",
		)
		
		This is inspired from Python
		
			items = [
				1,
				2,
				3,
			]

			print(items)
		
	
	* Functions

		In the same way as the [Arrays] example.

		Function TestFunction(
			a1:Int, a2:Int, a3:Int, a4:Int,
			b1:Int, b2:Int, b3:Int, b4:Int,
			c1:Int, c2:Int, c3:Int, c4:Int,
			d1:Int, d2:Int, d3:Int, d4:Int
		)
		
			Print("Boost!"
			
		End
		
		
		This is something as well inspired from Python

			def action(
				a,b,
				c,d,
			):
				print("OK")

			action(1,2,3,4)

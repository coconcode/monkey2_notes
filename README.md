# Monkey2 Notes

In this repository there will be documentation about various language features, suggestions, feedback, as for improving various aspects of Monkey2 programming language.

These notes are unnoficial and experimental so nothing is finalized and everything is an ongoing research process.

The final purpose will be to refine any useful findings and formulate proposals to Blitz Research for future improvements.

Normally the point of normal comments is to be ignored
and in another case of where #Rem style comments are used
only for documentation purposes.

This is a special case of where meta comments might work
exactly as normal comments would, but more specifically,
provide a standard convention on signifying and describing
various important information regarding the code state.

The idea is to have a special character (like #) to signify
the meta comment keyword, and then have various utilities
in the Monkey2 system handle these as needed.

Some example of such useful operations would be:

1. Folding the code into regions:

	'#region Name of the region
	'#endregion
	
	Note: This is a feature that must be supported
	from the IDE first and foremost, but the idea
	here is to establish the convention.
	
2. Cutting the code into different topics (or chapters):

	'#topic Name of the topic
	' various functions on this topic
	
	'#topic Name of another topic
	' various other functions as well
	
	Note: This is a case of where the IDE would draw
	a line over the screen, in some sense is very
	similar to #region but without the need to enclose something.
	
3. Shorter documentation

	'#doc Adding two numbers
	Function AddTwo(a:Int, b:Int)
		Return a + b
	End
	
	Note: This is an alternative way to provide
	documentation for the code in a more compact fashion
	(a one-liner), while on the other hand #Rem 
	needs three lines by default.
	
	In a special case of where the documetation needs
	two be expanded in more than one lines, can be written as this.
		
	'#doc Adds two numbers together.
	'#doc Takes two integer numbers as input parameters
	'#doc adds them together and returns a new integer result.
	Function AddTwo(a:Int, b:Int)
		Return a + b
	End

4. The idea of this notation is to be used in
a lot of other and different circumstances.

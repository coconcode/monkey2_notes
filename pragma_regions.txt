Notes:
  *   This might be deprecated in favor of metacomments.
      The cost of this implementation is that requires
      more work on the parser side, but overall offers a more
      principled and polished look on the language.
      
      While metacomments on the other hand would be considered
      as a "hack" to get things done within the existing features.
  

In this case there is the suggestion to have a special preprocessor tag named [#Region] that will allow to "virtualy" split the code into user-defined sections. This will allow in some cases better organization of the code in design presentation terms. By grouping related elements together and forming sections of strong relevance the programmer might have the ability to create more well defined code within a file.

Notes:
* In this example the suggested tag is [#Region], however any other possible alternatives can be considered as well.
* This feature to be fully realized depends on support from IDE or text editors. But at least firstly there is the need for establishing it clearly in the specifications of the programming language.

```
#Region Functions from category [A]
Function A1()
End

Function A2()
End

Function A2()
End
#End

#Region Functions from category [B]
Function B1()
End

Function B2()
End

Function B2()
End
#End
```
